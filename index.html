<!-- Post-Reflective Notes: That shit was hard! This project is my first major experience with programming; all code literally looked like a foreign language to me when I started, which I am happy to report is no longer true. Every single piece of this website was made by Googling "how to ___ in html/javascript" and following tutorials from everywhere around the web. The end result resembles a Frankenstein monster for that reason! However, I was focused less on writing cohesive, flexible, efficient code and focused more on understanding the general process of building a website. Mission accomplished! I plan to continue making (hopefully better) things and this little project will serve as a "baby picture" for me to analyze my growth on that journey. -->

		<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

		<fieldset><legend>ABOUT</legend>
		<p>Welcome to my very first website! My name is Alex and I'm teaching myself to program. I ultimately want to help create resources for people who are gender queer and/or on the autism spectrum, but that sounds so beyond my reach right now with my current experience (none), so in the meantime here’s a simple practice website I'm making based on my favorite childhood word game, <a href="http://www.madlibs.com/history/" id= "history-link" target="_blank">Mad Libs&reg;</a>!<br><br> I think I’ll gain over 500XP from this little project.</p></fieldset>
